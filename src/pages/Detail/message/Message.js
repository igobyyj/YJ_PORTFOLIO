          YJ pinpoints the communication problem of the current generation—
          Millennials and
          <br />
          Generation Z.
          <br />
          <br />
          With social technologies available at our fingertips, people can
          contact each other very
          <br />
          easily. However, these same technologies also distract people from
          valuing moments of face
          <br />
          to face interaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          She believes morse code could become an effective communication means
          to solve the
          <br />
          problem. Because morse code is solely based on sound or light (blink),
          people have to fully
          <br />
          concentrate on other during a conversation instead of taking each
          other’s existence for
          <br />
          granted. This thinking process becomes a core motif for her to use
          morse code to create a<br />
          video.
