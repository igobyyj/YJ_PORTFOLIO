          The poster is about one thing in her life that she is most grateful
          forâ€” love.
          <br />
          When thinking of love, people tend to visualize beauty and hope.
          <br />
          However, she captures ridiculous, inconvenient, and consuming essences
          of love through <br />a huge abstract image in the middle which
          reflects her belief that they are the aspects of love <br />
          that make people grow stronger.
