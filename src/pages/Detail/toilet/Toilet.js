          A situation in which a person cannot obtain something he or she
          desperately needs evokes a<br />
          feeling of anger. In the video, a man is trying to reach for the
          toilet paper but he cannot
          <br />
          because it is constantly moving. YJ creates the video to discuss the
          emotion of anger in an
          <br />
          interesting manner.
        </div>
